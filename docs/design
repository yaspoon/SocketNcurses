Server:
Has a array of upto 32 clients, new clients object created for each new connection
Client sends a uuid in its connection request which is then stored in the client object

each client object has a player object associated with it, stores the in game details, xyz

Network connection logic
Client sends connect event to network object and sets state to CONNECT
Client Network object sends CONNECTION_REQUEST frame and creates a new client with status CONNECT (i.e the server is the client)
Server Network ojbect receives CONNECTION_REQUEST frame
then creates a new "client" in it's list of connections with the new clients address, port and id and status set to CONNECT
and creates a CONNECT event with the ID in it and places it in the event queue
Server get the CONNECT event and creates a new client and adds it to it's list of clients
with the clients id set to the events id and status set to CONNECT
Server creates event CONNECT_ACK with the clients ID and sends it to the server network object
Server network object receives the event and looks up the clients id in it's table and sends a CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACK
to the address and port of the client
Client network object receives the CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACK and creates a CONNECT_ACK event and sends it to the client
CLient receives the CONNECT_ACK event and then waits for a CONNECTED event
Server sets client state to CONNECTING and creates a CONNECTED event and sends it to the server network object
Server Network object recevies CONNECTED event and sets clients status to CONNECTING sends CONNECTION_ACCEPTED frame
Client netowrk object receives CONNECTION_ACCEPTED frame
creates a CONNECTED and sends it to the client
client receives CONNECTED event and sets it's status to connected then creates a CONNECTED_ACK event and sends it to the network
client network object receives CONNECTED_ACK event and sends a CONNECTION_ACCEPTED_ACK frame to server
server network object receives CONNECTION_ACCEPTED_ACK frame from client network object
sets clients status in it's list to connected and creates a CONNECTED_ACK event and sends it to the server object
server receives CONNECTED_ACK event from client and sets clients status in it's list to connected
